**1. How do I approach designing software?**
* What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?\
This project was a great opportunity to grow my design skills, especially when it came to lighting, layout, and working within a 3D space. I got better at thinking spatially and figuring out how to position and size objects so everything looked realistic and fit together well. I also learned how to balance different lighting types, like ambient, diffuse, and specular, to create a more believable and visually appealing atmosphere.

* What design process did you follow for your project work?\
I started by brainstorming which objects I wanted to include and how I wanted the scene to be set up. Once I had a clear idea, I took many reference photos from different angles to help with sizing and positioning during the modeling process. Then I built the scene in phases—first modeling the objects, then adding camera controls, followed by textures, and finally lighting. I kept testing and tweaking along the way to make sure each piece added to the overall mood I was aiming for.

* How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?\
The strategy of breaking a large goal into smaller design phases can definitely help me in future projects. Planning out the visual and functional parts separately, then integrating them step by step, made the process feel less overwhelming. I also found that testing visuals often and iterating based on how things look in real time is an effective way to refine the design.

**2. How do I approach developing programs?**
* What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?\
While building this 3D scene, I relied a lot more on visual feedback than I usually do in other programming projects. I learned to treat the development process as both technical and creative. One strategy I used was testing frequently after each small change, whether I was adjusting lighting, positioning an object, or tweaking camera angles. This helped me better understand how visual code like shaders actually affects the scene.

* How did iteration factor into your development?\
Iteration was a huge part of this project. I constantly made changes based on how the scene looked during testing. For example, I would adjust the brightness of a light or reposition an object, then run the program to see how it looked before tweaking it again. There were many small cycles of test, adjust, and retest. This trial-and-error method helped me catch problems early and improve the overall quality of the scene.

* How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?\
At the beginning, I focused more on just getting things to work. But as the project went on, I started thinking more about how clean and organized my code was. I began using comments more often and grouping related functionality together, especially when dealing with shader logic or object transformations. I also became more comfortable switching between design thinking and debugging. By the end, my workflow felt more balanced between writing logic and testing how things actually looked in the scene.

**3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
* How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?\
Working on this project gave me a much better understanding of how math, logic, and visual creativity all come together in computer science. Learning how to use lighting, transformations, and shaders helped me connect abstract concepts, like vectors and matrices, to real visual results. This experience will definitely help me in future courses that involve simulations, game development, or any sort of graphical programming because I now have hands-on practice with how a scene is built and rendered.

* How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?\
Professionally, I can see how the skills I gained from this project could apply to careers in software development and design. Building and troubleshooting a 3D scene really taught me to think more about the user experience and how to make things visually clear and appealing. Working with lighting and shaders pushed me to improve my debugging and problem-solving skills, which are useful no matter what area of tech I end up in.
